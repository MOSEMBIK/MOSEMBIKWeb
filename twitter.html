		A BRIEF HISTORY OF THE EVER-EXPANDING TWEET

			For as long as <a href="http://www.twitter.com">Twitter</a> has existed, it has been a place of brevity,
			if not levity. The 140 character limit - originally created so that
			tweets could fit into single <abbr title="Short Message Service">SMS</abbr> messages - is as much a part of the
			brand as the silhouetted bird. You want to yell about the <abbr title="National Football League"><a href="http://www.nfl.com">NFL</a></abbr>, hurl
			some insults at the president? Fine. Just make it quick.
		</p>
		<p class="ttpcenter">
		Starting today, the platform will let a small group of beta testers
		experiment with a 280 character limit, doubling what can fit into a
		single tweet.
		</p>
		<p class="ttpcenter">
		Twitter says it made the move primarily for parity in language.
		<q>Our research shows us that the character limit is a major cause of
		frustration for people tweeting in English, but it is not for those
		tweeting in Japanese</q> says Aliza Rosen, a product manager at Twitter.

			<blockquote cite="Jack Dorsey, Twitter CEO">
				"This is a small change, but a big move for us. 140 was an arbitrary
				choice based on the 160 character <abbr title="Short Message Service">SMS</abbr> limit. Proud of how thoughtful
				the team has been in solving a real problem people have when trying
				to tweet. And at the same time maintaining our brevity, speed,
				and essence!"

			</blockquote>

		<p class="ttpcenter">
		This will be the first time that Twitter directly increases the
		charactercount on tweets, but it follows a string of subtle changes
		to <em>maximize</em> the amount of content users can stuff inside a single
		tweet.
