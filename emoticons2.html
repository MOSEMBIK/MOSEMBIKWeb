	<h1> Emoticons </h1>
		<p>
			Emoticons are textual portrayals of a writer's moods or facial expressions in the form of icons. Originally, these icons consisted of ASCII art.
			<br>
			<br>
			Emoticons can generally be divided into two groups: Western (mainly from America and Europe) or horizontal; Eastern or vertical (mainly from east Asia).

	<h2> Western </h2>
		<p>
			Western style emoticons are mostly written from left to right as though the head is rotated counter-clockwise 90 degrees.
